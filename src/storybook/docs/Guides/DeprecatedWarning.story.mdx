## Deprecated Warning

If you use some deprecated methods, we will show warning when you use in development mode,
if you don't want see those warning, you can turn off that by set

```ts
import { configure } from '@ringcentral/juno';

configure({
  warning: false,
});
```

or just use window to set

```ts
window.__JUNO__.WARNING_IGNORE = true;
```

**BUT, Don't recommended you close it, we should avoid use any deprecated props or methods.**
