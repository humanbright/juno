<Meta title="ðŸ“– Guides/Use Lato Font" />

### Font

JUNO was designed with the [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) font in mind.
But the Lato font will **not** be automatically loaded by JUNO. The developer is responsible for loading all fonts used in their application.

#### Lato font CDN

Shown below is a sample link markup used to load the Lato font from a CDN:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lato:400,700,900" />
```

#### Install with npm package

JUNO depends on `typeface-lato` package. If you are using `webpack` with `css-loader` or `scss-loader`, you can import it directly in your project.

In your JS entry-point:

```js
import 'typeface-lato'
```

Or in your SCSS file:

```scss
@import '~typeface-lato/index.css';
```
